        <h2>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h2>
        <p>
          The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction
          comedy series created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy
          broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it was later adapted to other formats,
          and over several years it gradually became an international multi-media
          phenomenon. Adaptations have included stage shows, a "trilogy" of five
          books published between 1979 and 1992, a sixth novel penned by Eoin
          Colfer in 2009, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 computer game, and three series
          of three-part comic book adaptations of the first three novels published
          by DC Comics between 1993 and 1996.

          There were also two series of towels,
          produced by Beer-Davies, that are considered by some fans to be an
          "official version" of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as they
          include text from the first novel. A Hollywood-funded film version,
          produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio
          adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from
          2004 to 2005.
