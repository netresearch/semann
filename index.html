            Ulo The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction
            comedy series created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy
            broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it was later adapted to other formats,
            and over several years it gradually became an international multi-media
            phenomenon. Adaptations have included stage shows, a "trilogy" of five
            books published between 1979 and 1992, a sixth novel penned by Eoin
            Colfer in 2009, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 computer game, and three series
            of three-part comic book adaptations of the first three novels published
            by DC Comics between 1993 and 1996. There were also two series of towels,
            produced by Beer-Davies, that are considered by some fans to be an
            "official version" of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as they
            include text from the first novel. A Hollywood-funded film version,
            produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio
            adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from
            2004 to 2005.
